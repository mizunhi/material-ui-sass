material-ui-sass backward compatible
====================================

This is a modified version of [material-ui-sass](https://github.com/gpbl/material-ui-sass) that works properly
with [gulp-sass](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass) and [gulp-csso](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-csso).

Is also compatible with older versions of SASS.

TODO:
- npm package
